Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland. At nearly 10 million people, the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the nation. Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. Chicago lays claim to many regional specialties that reflect the city's ethnic and working-class roots. Included among these are its nationally renowned deep-dish pizza. \n\nAs Chicago is known for its Pizza specialties, our customer is looking to open an upscale Pizza place in Chicago. The intention on this project is to collect and provide a data driven recommendation that can identify ideal location for opening an upscale Pizza place. Chicago Community areas are chosen for the ideal location. Core of Chicago is made of 77 communities, but we will focus on communities with larger population and higher per capita income as the restaurant is of a premium type. \n",
